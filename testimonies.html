                <h4>SHEKINAH GLORY TESTIMONY OF GRACE</h4>
                <h6>(Divine HeaLing And Rescue From Arrow Of Untimely Death In The Hand Of occultic Husband)</h6>
                <p>
                  I was healed from a poisoned leg that almost claimed my life and also delivered from death in the wicked
                  grip of my occultic husband. My husband was not only wicked but highly occultic such that i never experienced
                  what is called love.<br><br>
                  Suddenly, i began to suffer sickness of all sorts but but shockenly he never showed interest, instead:
                  he took a stance that made my siyuation worse. I was also having all kinds of terrible dreams that indicted
                  himfor being responsible to my situation. I started going for prayers from church to church for solution .
                  Prophesies kept pointing at my husband as being responsible but what i did not understand was why after spending
                  all my money in following their prayer directions and "special work" my matter continued to be worse rather than get 
                  better. Besides, after all the "enemy die by fire" prayers with all the spendings, my husband was still
                  bouncing in his wickedness. Out of frustration, i stopped going to church.<br><br>
                  One faithful day members of Christlove Family Church came to minister to me in my shop.  They declined answering
                  my barage of questions instead they invited me to come and see the G.O. for clarification and counseling.
                  However they shared the testimony of how the General Overseer once died and came back to life with a message from God to God's 
                  children and the church. Part of the message was that we should leave enemies alone and seek to live to please God.
                  I then concluded to visit him believing that he must be different from others who duped me without any improvement
                  in my situation. The moment the G.O sets his eyes on me as i entered the church. He began to tell me mysteries about my life.
                  He asked, how can you expect God's intervention when you refused to servehim as a minister and said nothing can work for 
                  you until you answer God work for him. Meanwhile, i had tried all mannerof businesses but nothing worked, instead all my money
                  would go like that. He gave me 3 days dry fasting to enable me tidy up with God through repentance and promise to serve him in orther to attract his 
                  mercy and prompt intervention. i embraced the 3 days fasting with all my heart not minding my condition. This was the beginning of my turnaround experience
                  as i settled with the church. At a time i had a dream wher3 God sent me to the General Overseerer for him to direct me on what God asked me to do.
                   He pointed me to join the worker/minsters Holyghost incubation trainning course and arm of the church "HolyGhost University". In the course of this dicipleship programme,
                   I had a strange encounter one night. I saw myself lying on a laboratoty bed being operated upon by angelic doctors and nurses.
                    In the morning, i discovered one spot in my leg has opened up and poisionous, smelling contaminations were pouring out in form of purse. After that, the injury dried up 
                    and i was heald. i began to walk and move freely unlike before. GLORY TO GOD! Few days to the end of the programme, A prophesy came to me that someone very close to me 
                    had perfected plan to use me and some of my children for rituals. God said that it was for that reason he asked me to join the programme. He had seen my heart and was ready to fight the battle for me.
                  The prophesy went on to say that i should look unto him, God as my husband and forget about human husband from that day. <br><br>
                  One faithful day as the man of God took us on a very serious deliverance session, He directed a prayer that God should turn to miracleevery obstacle that hindered our progressive work with God.
                   It was that same day that the occultic arrow of death that has been tormenting me left me and went back to the sender. The next morning report of his death was brought to me to the church by my daughter
                   in the company of a young man who was our neigbhour. That same day as he was lying down with my dayghter, he began to urinate on the bed, suddenly blood started gushing out of his mouth and followed by foam 
                   as he struggled with breath.<br><br>
                   Truly, God's word is truth "whatsover a man sowes that he shall also reap" (Gal 6: 7) and beloved a mans worst enemy is a member of his household. That was how God rescued me and my children from wicked arrow of death and granted us GRACE 
                   for life of a new beginning in him. i have sincebeen working in God's vein yard as an evangelist of God. TO GOD BE THE GLORY, Honour and adoration ( Romans 8 28-37).

                <h4>NEW BEGINNING TESTIMONY</h4>
                <h6>DELIVERANCE FROM DEMONIC TORMENT AND UNTIMELY DEATH</h6>
                <p>We were under torments resulting from Ancesteral covenant yoke, Ocultic bondage and 
                  idolatrous family foundation.
                 <br> We suffered terrible under diverse manipulations from fraustrations, confusions, distrust,
                  brotherly hatred and untimely death of great destinies.<br><br>
                  suprisingly, God continued to save me from the death traps notably when an upstairs building 
                  colllapsed on me where i was relaxing in our own compound.<br><br>
                  I was also involved in a Ghastly motor accident that buchered many lives. Every effort to find solution
                  failed as more Prophecies kept coming that more of us are in the occultic waiting list for pre-mature death.<br><br>
                  Finally God brought me in contact with the Apostle Of New Beginning who clearly told me that 
                  nothing around me or my family will work until i surrender to God's call as a full time pastor.
                  He added that i was chosen from the womb as a David for deliverance of my family from Goliath
                  and for restoring my family to God's original plan. As i obeyed and began God's full time pastoral
                  work, God opened my eyes to know that i have been wasting time pursuing the wrong purpose and working in the wrong veineyards.<br><br>
                  God of Apostle Ucheya was true to his words; everything that refused to work started working especially
                  after a family liberation was done in my home as God directed. we have been experiencing turn-around.<br><br>
                  Impossibility have become possible, The Goliath terrorising the family surrendered to God through an open 
                  confession during the family liberation, untimely sudden death has since seized and peace and love returned to the family.<br><br>
                  My pastoral work has been a great experience with concrete evidence to God's power and glory.
                  Today i am a living WONDER, i return all Glory To God...

                <h6>TRULY JESUS POWER NA SUPER POWER </h6>
                <p>When my business was goinging down, I got in contact with a customer who gave me black soap
                  to bath for customers attraction. <br><br>
                  Later she came with their pastor and prayed in my shop with candles and other religious materials,
                  but instead of experiencing sales increase, my business blocked totally.<BR><br>
                    I was into this confusion when i came in contact with propserity in Jesus business men fellowship><br><br>
                    I joined them for the first time and by the Grace of God i provided what we used for entertainment that day
                    during "Sharing at the table of the Lord" as is in the practice.<br><br>
                    I did not explain my prdicament yet <br><br>
                    But Apostle Of New Beginning blessed pure water which i bought and gave me a sachet to 
                    sprinkle in my shop.<br><br>
                    As i carried out the assignment the way i was directed, that was how sales opened up. <br><br>
                    That very day i sold as i have never done before, i was even telling customer to come next time 
                    because of the rush. <br><br>
                    Since then till now the sales have not diminished. <br><br>
                    Prosperity in Jesus is a reality.

                <h6>DELIVERANCE FROM DEMONIC TORMENT AND UNTIMELY DEATH</h6>
                <p>We were under torments resulting from Ancesteral covenant yoke, Ocultic bondage and 
                  idolatrous family foundation.
                 <br> We suffered terrible under diverse manipulations from fraustrations, confusions, distrust,
                  brotherly hatred and untimely death of great destinies.<br><br>
                  suprisingly, God continued to save me from the death traps notably when an upstairs building 
                  colllapsed on me where i was relaxing in our own compound.<br><br>
                  I was also involved in a Ghastly motor accident that buchered many lives. Every effort to find solution
                  failed as more Prophecies kept coming that more of us are in the occultic waiting list for pre-mature death.<br><br>
                  Finally God brought me in contact with the Apostle Of New Beginning who clearly told me that 
                  nothing around me or my family will work until i surrender to God's call as a full time pastor.
                  He added that i was chosen from the womb as a David for deliverance of my family from Goliath
                  and for restoring my family to God's original plan. As i obeyed and began God's full time pastoral
                  work, God opened my eyes to know that i have been wasting time pursuing the wrong purpose and working in the wrong veineyards.<br><br>
                  God of Apostle Ucheya was true to his words; everything that refused to work started working especially
                  after a family liberation was done in my home as God directed. we have been experiencing turn-around.<br><br>
                  Impossibility have become possible, The Goliath terrorising the family surrendered to God through an open 
                  confession during the family liberation, untimely sudden death has since seized and peace and love returned to the family.<br><br>
                  My pastoral work has been a great experience with concrete evidence to God's power and glory.
                  Today i am a living WONDER, i return all Glory To God...

                <h6>TRULY JESUS POWER NA SUPER POWER </h6>
                <p>When my business was goinging down, I got in contact with a customer who gave me black soap
                  to bath for customers attraction. <br><br>
                  Later she came with their pastor and prayed in my shop with candles and other religious materials,
                  but instead of experiencing sales increase, my business blocked totally.<BR><br>
                    I was into this confusion when i came in contact with propserity in Jesus business men fellowship><br><br>
                    I joined them for the first time and by the Grace of God i provided what we used for entertainment that day
                    during "Sharing at the table of the Lord" as is in the practice.<br><br>
                    I did not explain my prdicament yet <br><br>
                    But Apostle Of New Beginning blessed pure water which i bought and gave me a sachet to 
                    sprinkle in my shop.<br><br>
                    As i carried out the assignment the way i was directed, that was how sales opened up. <br><br>
                    That very day i sold as i have never done before, i was even telling customer to come next time 
                    because of the rush. <br><br>
                    Since then till now the sales have not diminished. <br><br>
                    Prosperity in Jesus is a reality.
