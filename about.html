      <h2>MAJOR YEARLY PROGRAMME OF THE CHURCH</h2>
      <h5>HOLY-LOVE FOUNDATION LAYING PROGRAMME.</h5><br>
      <p>We begin the year with 40 days fasting and praying foundation laying programme ( 6: 00am - 6:00 pm)
        stretching from the last two weeks of january called the Holy month to the last week of febuary called 
        Covenant Month. It is rounded up with a three days dry fasting on the last 3 days before the very last
        sunday of febuary and sealed with love feast. the last 5 Sundays are observed as 5 Covenant Sundays to
        address the 5 core values of the church - Christove, Holiness and Purity, Truth, Obedience to the core 
        and Higher Faith.
      </p>

      <ol >
        <li class="fw-bold">HOLY MONTH</li>
        <p>Every january is crowned with two weeks fasting, teaching and praying revival meeting called Holy weeks. 
          Fasting duration is 6:00am - 6:00pm everyday for the period it will last. We end the fasting to Close
          with baptism of new members and Holy communion for all baptized brethren. The focus of teaching is on 
          Kingdom principles maturing into christ nature of purity or Holylove wich is the first core values of 
          the church.
        </p>
        <li class="fw-bold">COVENANT MONTH</li>
        <p>Expository teaching on Kingdom secrets that makes great which builds covenant relationship, revival 
          and substenance. Covenant is a love word for ensuring a healthy relationship which guides us to attaining
          God's best in ministry, marriage , homes, offices, famiies and church. members are led to renounce evil
          covenants, renew their covenants with God or enter fresh ones as need be. we observe five covenant sundays
           each of which is dedicated to each of the major new beginning covenants. Such as covenant of marriage 
           and family life, prosperity and fruitfulness. Divine health and long life, covenant of love, Obedience
           to the core, covenant of Higher faith, Holiness and purity, etc..
        </p>

        <li class="fw-bold">EASTER RETREAT</li>
        <p>Seven days revival meeting in all tagged: Power and Glory conference which will last for 7 days.
          The meeting consists of expository teaching on christ cross and its significance to the end time church.
          The focus is to point the church back to the cross which is the cruxx of Christ believing faith to unveil
          the mystery of Christlove as the core of glorious gospel of Christ Kingdom - message to the cross.
          The cross as the full payment of debt is the container while love is the content of the experience which
          releases Christlife ( kingdom lifestyle). " No cross, No Crown, No story, No Glory". Through Christ Cross
          every story will change hand to Christ Glory. Hallelujahs, now we can do all things through Grace which
          we did not receive by our works but which we receive for good works, Grace for Grace.
