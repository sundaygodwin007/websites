            </center>

            <p>
                Prosperity in Jesus was unveiled by master Jesus Christ to the visioner Ucheya Orie Y. Apostle
                of New Beginning, when in the year 2010 ( April-May) he had an encounter with the Lord that led
                to his death and subsequently being resurrected by the Lord in May 14<sup>th</sup>.<br>
                Before Jesus resurrected him, he showed him mystery surrouning the present day drifting away prodigal
                church God's people are eventually becoming poor, weak, sick, decaying and powerless. He was then commissioned
                with a higher mandate to go back to the world to blow the last trumpet-discipling the church and nations,
                restoring God's peope to the lords Glory through <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Endtime Apostolic Message of New Beginning in Christ"</span>
